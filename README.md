This Terraform configuration creates a Kubernetes deployment with the specified number of replicas and Docker image. To use this configuration, you will need to have a Kubernetes cluster running and authenticated with your Kubernetes configuration file.

You can run the following Terraform commands to initialize the configuration, preview the changes, and apply the changes:

```terraform

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

When you run terraform apply, Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes before applying them to your Kubernetes cluster. Once you confirm the changes, Terraform will create the Kubernetes deployment and output the deployment name, number of replicas, and Docker image name.
